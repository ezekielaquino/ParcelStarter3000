# ParcelStarter3000 📦🐣
Quick starter for doing anything™ web with Parcel bundler

## What
This is just my basic configuration for starting anything be it a simple website or an experiment! It uses the amazingly uncomplicated and amazing Parcel bundler 🌈 because it's all about getting started!

## How
Assuming you already have node installed on your system
- Clone this repository
- `cd` into where you cloned it
- `yarn start`

That's it!

When you're ready to build just `yarn build`

## Extras
- This also includes a basic prettier config
- `yarn start` and `build` clears `.cache` every run
- `yarn build` also clears out your `dist` folder
- you can place static assets in `static` folder and they won't be file rev'ed
